# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    We promise to do our best to make the best possible website for our client.

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - finish work at least a day in advance (Tuesday night)
    - everyone pulls their own weight
    - don't force delete anyone else's work without consulting the group first
    - show up prepared to every meeting and try your best to work ahead on every Milestone
    - start milestone 2 during project 3

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - meet at least twice a week
    - try to respond to text messages within 30 minutes

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - we will contact them via text and set up meetings to go over design, content, etc.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    - Khushi hands in the assignments
    - Jenna keeps everyone on track (i.e. checks in on members and makes sure we're all completing the tasks)
    - Jenna gets client, interviews client, communicates with client, gets content from client
    - Rory coordinates potential meeting times by finding when people are free to meet

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - We will use majority vote when conflicts or disagreements arise.
    - If someone isn't pulling their weight, we will remind them in the group chat what to get done.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
